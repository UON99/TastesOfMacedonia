# Tastes of Macedonia - Project Description

## 1.	Introduction
Tastes of Macedonia is a Web application that helps the users to find the restaurants according to their requirements. The main aim of the project is to provide the users an easy to use application that helps them to find restaurants according to their tastes and convenience.
With the help of OpenStreetMap users will be able to find restaurants in Macedonia, see their working hours, as well as the exact address and the phone number of the restaurants.
### 1.1	Purpose
The purpose of this document is to set out the requirements for the development of the Tastes of Macedonia application. The system is a web application that can be opened with any device that supports browsers. Building web applications has become increasingly popular. Web application development has brought improvements over antiquated methods of using monolithic architecture for software development as it demanded a different approach for architectural design. Monolithic architectural design-based software took more time to develop and if they had a bug whole application used to mess up. Web application development is quite popular as the web app can be debugged even when it is running. By building web applications, you can cut cost and time. 
The purpose of this project is to enable the users to more efficiently access to variety of choices that the city is offering. With that, the users will have the possibility to make the choice of their own which is corresponding to their current wishes, desires and/or mood.
### 1.2	Scope
The application is intended for a wide range of users. The restaurants shown on the accurate city map will all be offering local or regional cuisine. Reason behind this is to allow the tourists to see where they can try the local specialties. Consequently, there is no doubt that the tourists will gain most benefits from the application.
